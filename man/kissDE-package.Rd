\title{Retrieves condition-specific variants in RNA-seq data}

\description{The \pkg{kissDE} package retrieves condition-specific variants in 
RNA-seq data. Each variation (SNVs, alternative splicing events) is 
represented as a pair of variants. The quantification of each variant is 
summarized as a count, in each condition and each replicate where it was 
measured. The package tests for enrichment of a variant in a condition. Data 
counts are modelled using either a poisson or a negative binomial.
Likelihood ratio tests are then performed 
using the GLM (Generalized Linear Model) framework.
